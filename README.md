### Hi there, I'm AJ! 👋

I'm a cybersecurity researcher based out of Orlando, Florida. I graduated from the University of Central Florida and was honored to be one of its first recipients of the [NSF's CyberCorps Scholarship for Service](https://www.ucf.edu/news/nsf-awards-ucf-2-9-million-to-train-next-generation-of-cybersecurity-defenders/) award.

#### Cool things I'm working on...
- 🌐 **Cloak** is a man-in-the-middle packet capture and analysis system I managed over the past 2 semesters as part of UCF's CS Senior Design course. I additionally conducted Data Analytics and Networking development. Check out a demo [here](https://youtu.be/pL6mPNrJn6c?t=310)!
- 💻 [My homelab](https://ajfu.to/homelab) is forever growing and changing! I primarily use it as a file/backup server, a media server, and a VM/sandbox environment.
- 🌱 I compiled a repository of useful information for the [Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) certification [here](https://github.com/ajfuto/comptia-security-plus)!
