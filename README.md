### Hi there, I'm A.J.! 👋

I'm a Computer Scientist and cybersecurity professional in training based out of Orlando, Florida. I'm honored to be a recipient of the [NSF's CyberCorps Scholarship for Service](https://www.ucf.edu/news/nsf-awards-ucf-2-9-million-to-train-next-generation-of-cybersecurity-defenders/) award.

#### Cool things I'm working on...
- 🔒 The [NSA Codebreaker Challenge](https://nsa-codebreaker.org/home) was held in the latter half of 2021. I completed 6 tasks involving network forensics, reverse engineering, and more! I also finished within the top 8% of over 5,000 registered participants!
- 💻 My homelab is forever growing and changing! I primarily use it as a file/backup server, a [Plex](https://plex.tv/) media server, and a VM/sandbox environment.
- 🌱 I recently passed my [Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) certification! Check out a repository I made with useful information for the exam [here](https://github.com/ajfuto/comptia-security-plus)!
- 🌐 **Cloak** is a man-in-the-middle packet capture and analysis system I managed over the past 2 semesters as part of UCF's CS Senior Design course. I additionally conducted Data Analytics and Networking development. Check out a demo [here](https://youtu.be/pL6mPNrJn6c?t=310)!
