### Hi there, I'm A.J.! 👋

I'm a Computer Scientist based out of Orlando, Florida and a cybersecurity professional in training. I'm honored to be a recipient of the [NSF's CyberCorps Scholarship for Service](https://www.ucf.edu/news/nsf-awards-ucf-2-9-million-to-train-next-generation-of-cybersecurity-defenders/) award.
