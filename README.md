### Hi there, I'm A.J.! 👋

I'm a Computer Scientist and cybersecurity professional in training based out of Orlando, Florida. I'm honored to be a recipient of the [NSF's CyberCorps Scholarship for Service](https://www.ucf.edu/news/nsf-awards-ucf-2-9-million-to-train-next-generation-of-cybersecurity-defenders/) award.

#### Cool things I'm working on...
- 🔒 The [NSA Codebreaker Challenge](https://nsa-codebreaker.org/home) was held in the latter half of 2021. I completed 6 tasks involving network forensics, reverse engineering, and more! I also finished within the top 8% of over 5,000 registered participants!
- 💻 My homelab is forever growing and changing! I primarily use it as a file/backup server, a [Plex](https://plex.tv/) media server, and a VM/sandbox environment.
- 🌱 I'm studying for my [Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) certification, which I plan to take prior to the summer of 2022! Check out my progress [here](https://github.com/ajfuto/comptia-security-plus)!
